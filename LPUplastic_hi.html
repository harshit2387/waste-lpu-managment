        Awareness and individual action will always be the primary source of change.
         Our habit of throwing organic waste in closed plastic containers and polyethene covers reduce their recyclability value tremendously.
    </p>pre></p>                                                       
    <pre>
         pollution has been firmly established as one of the greatest dangers to the environment today, and for a good reason.
          The disposal systems meant to tackle plastic waste are inadequate, which is why vast quantities of it are winding up in the oceans.

        Plastic wreaks havoc on marine life and leeches toxic chemicals into their bloodstream. 
        These chemicals eventually enter human food supplies. Even on the earth, plastic causes a host of civic problems such as blocking drains,
         creating pools of stagnant water which are fertile breeding grounds for vector-borne diseases.
        
        Even the plastic which ends up in “proper” disposal channels causes problems. Plastic recycling systems are inefficient, and therefore the process is economically
         unviable. 
        Waste is often redirected to incinerators instead, which contributes significantly to air pollution because of the use of low-quality machinery.
        
        Or plastic ends up in landfills, which, in India and many other parts of the world, are unsanitary and cause chemicals to leach into the soil and water. </pre>                                                               <!--indian laws to save how to save point-->

            <h1 style=color:black>here are 4 way's to save earth from enviroment pollution! </h1>
            Plastic pollution is a serious threat to the environment and the health of living creatures. It affects the oceans, land, and air, 
            and causes harm to wildlife, ecosystems, and human populations. There are many ways to reduce plastic waste and prevent plastic pollution, such as:

            1>Avoid using single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, bottles, straws, cutlery, and cups. Instead, use reusable alternatives, such as cloth bags,
             metal bottles, bamboo straws, and ceramic mugs.

            2>Buy products in bulk or with minimal packaging. Choose products that are made of natural or biodegradable materials, such as paper, cardboard, wood, 
            or cotton.

            3>Recycle as much as possible. Separate your waste into different bins for paper, plastic, metal, and organic materials.
             Check the recycling symbols on the products and follow the instructions. Do not throw away items that can be recycled.

            4>Support initiatives that aim to reduce plastic pollution. Join campaigns that promote awareness and action on this issue. 
            Donate to organizations that work to clean up the environment and protect wildlife. Educate yourself and others about
              the effects of plastic pollution and the solutions.</pre></p>

    <h2 style=color:gold>5 INNOVATIONS THAT ARE HELPING SAVE THE PLANET FROM PLASTIC POLLUTION</h2>
    <p><pre>Plastic-eating bacteria In 2016,
        <h2> a Japanese scientist discovered a plastic-eating enzyme called Ideonella Sakaiensis 201-F6.</h2>
         This was secreted by a bacteria that survives on the carbon content in Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)  the most commonly used type of plastic
          (all disposable bottles are made from PET).The only downside is that the process is very slow; however, scientists are currently working
           on speeding up this process by up to 20 percent by changing the molecular structure of the enzyme.
         <mark>An <q>attractive</q> solution Scientists have built a type of magnetic coil that pulls microplastics that are present in the ocean.</mark> 
        It uses nanotechnology to break down the debris; the best part is that it happens without harming marine life in any way. 
        These minuscule coils are thinner than hair and are covered in nitrogen and manganese. 
        They break down the plastic when they interact with oxygen. In a contained study, it was found that these nano-coils can reduce microplastics by up to 50 percent in eight hours.
        <h2> Fuelling the future</h2>
         Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor (Cat-HTR) is a technology that takes plastic that cannot be recycled, melts it, and changes it into oil.
         <img:>
         The technology is called Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor (Cat-HTR), and it takes plastic that cannot be recycled, melts it, and changes it into oil. 
        The process is like using a pressure cooker and can convert any kind of single-use plastic into waxes, oils, and plastics that can then be made into other products.
         The manufacturers say that the technology can repurpose 20,000 tonnes of plastic a year and reduce the plastic that ends in landfills and the ocean.
          The downside is that the use of the technology produces carbon emission.
         <h2>An earthy solution</h2>
          Aspergillus Tubingensis is a fungus that is capable of degrading polyurethane (PU).
         The fungus was discovered by a biotech engineer, Samantha Jenkins, at British bio-manufacturing company Biohm.
         While studying a variety of fungi she noticed that one of the mushrooms had cracked through the container lid and was growing on it. 
        Interestingly, the fungi were being cultivated for use in bio insulation panels, but Jenkins
        <q>discovery took it down a different path. Biohm is not working on developing the fungus to creating a new type of biomaterial <q>
            for food, or feed stocks for animals, or antibiotics</q>.
            <h2>solution from ocen</h2>
         An Indonesian startup is working with seaweed farmers and using the harvest to develop packaging material. 
        .It is a type of plastic that is made from bio-based renewable resources.
         Ironically, the solution for plastic pollution comes from a source that has suffered the most as a result of the indiscriminate use of plastic.
          An example of this is Evoware, an Indonesian startup that is working with seaweed farmers and is using the harvest to develop packaging material.
        The packaging is used for food items, and can then be completely dissolved in hot water and even consumed.
         Although the country generates millions of tonnes of seaweed each year, there are certain challenges involved.
         One is cost as the seaweed wrapping is nearly five times as expensive as ordinary packaging.
         It also needs additional wrapping to protect the seaweed. 
         While several companies are innovating to make plastic substitutes including material made from bamboo and potato, mass adoption 
         may take time as these are still niche products that few people can afford.</pre></p>
